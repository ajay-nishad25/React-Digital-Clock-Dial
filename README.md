# Analog clock made using React Js

This is a straightforward implementation of React JS that creates an analog clock to display the current time. The clock features a classic circular design with hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. By utilizing the JavaScript Date object and React JS functionality, the clock updates in real-time, ensuring the hands are always pointing to the correct time. This analog clock is a great example of how React JS can be used to create functional and visually appealing components for any web-based project.
